# ZAVION MASTERMIND FINAL ROUND

This is submission for final round of ZAVION TECHFEST: MASTERMIND 2021. I have attached the notebook as pdf and also as a separate JuPyter notebook. I have created a text-based fantasy RPG simulation game, XENOVERSE. In this game, player is provided with two game modes.  

1.	Story Mode: A single player gaming mode where you play as a fantasy character and unravel the mysteries of the nearby land. The protagonist starts off with 4 vials of elemental power reserves. He/she can use each vial for once. Depending on the choices made, the ending will differ.   
2.	Versus Battle Mode: A two player gaming where the players battle off each other using the four basic elements. Each player starts with 100HP. Each attack reduces the HP by 5,10, and 15 depending on the element chosen by the opponent. First player to reach 0HP loses the game.  
  
NOTE: The input is CASE SENSITIVE. So, the inputs should be in UPPERCASE ALPHABETS.
