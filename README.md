# Xenoverse Tales

**Xenoverse Tales** is a text-based fantasy RPG simulation game developed as a submission for the final round of **ZAVION TECHFEST: MASTERMIND 2021**. The game offers two immersive game modes:  

### 🏹 Story Mode  
A single-player experience where you play as a fantasy character, unraveling the mysteries of the nearby land. The protagonist starts with **four vials of elemental power**, each usable **only once**. The choices you make will determine your fate, leading to multiple possible endings.  

### ⚔️ Versus Battle Mode  
A competitive two-player mode where players engage in elemental battles. Each player starts with **100 HP** and takes turns attacking with elemental abilities. Attacks reduce HP by **5, 10, or 15**, depending on the element chosen by the opponent. The first player to reach **0 HP** loses the game.  

### ⚠️ Important  
- **Inputs are CASE SENSITIVE** and must be entered in **UPPERCASE LETTERS**.
